        "91012": "It's the season to see ladybugs. They are so cute…",
        "91013": "It is indeed very hot… I would like to go to the lake, but let's cool off at the pool.",

        "91015": "Snow reminds me of Stollen… I used to help make them every Christmas.",
        "91016": "Ms. Falcon, she can tell what candy I made by the smell of my clothes. It's kind of embarrassing…",
        "91017": "Whenever I make a new product, Bakushin O always shows up to taste it. It's very helpful… but where in the world did she come from…?",
        "91018": "Lately I've been swapping homemade cakes with Ms. Flower. It tastes so tender… and so comforting.",
        "91019": "I believe that both racing and patissier work are equally challenging in terms of everything you have achieved.",
        "91020": "It is the pastry chef's job to color special occasions such as birthdays. Then I will… I will color the race with my running.",
        "91021": "The morning is the time to complete all the day's preparations… an ironclad rule for pastry chefs.",
        "91022": "Whether it's an after-dinner dessert or a snack… even if it's the same snack, we need to rearrange the timing and the content.",
        "91023": "Konditor… It could be said that a pastry chef's day begins at night. We have to prepare for tomorrow's event.",
        "91024": "In the season of cherry blossom viewing, it would be nice to make a stollen with the image of cherry blossoms instead of snow.",
        "91025": "Summer is the best time to travel in Germany. We'd love to show you around and are happy to help you with your schedule.",
        "91026": "I would love to go out to pick chestnuts… I just came up with a recipe for a delicious looking Mont Blanc.",
        "91027": "Valentine's Day, Christmas… When the time comes for sweets to be served, we are all in a state of excitement.",
        "91028": "A craftsman is essentially a title given after rigorous training. I would like to keep in mind the importance of this costume.",
        "91029": "When I wear this outfit, I feel motivated to work on the piece… it's kind of like before a race.",
        "92000": "Let's work together to reach our goals. First, a plan.",
        "92001": "Schedule confirmed, okay. Let's get started today.",
        "92002": "We may be far away, but we have a steady schedule and we will get there.",

        "92007": "If you think I'm being clumsy again, feel free to let me know.",
        "92011": "It's fresh… In Germany, lake bathing is more popular than sea bathing.",
        "92015": "Everything is ready. So, Öffnen… let's open the store.",
        "92016": "In racing, too, I will reach the level of a master… I promise.",
        "92017": "We will be precise in every step of the process, until we have completed our work of triumph.",
        "92018": "I see quite a bit of potential in protein cookies… both in taste and nutrition.",
        "92020": "For now, let's just focus on doing the best we can… and when we're done, we'll enjoy the sweet treats together.",
        "92021": "Preparation is essential so that the trainers can enjoy the taste of victory.",

        "20027": "With this condition, you can look forward to this race .……… Uh, it's nothing. Forget it.",
        "20028": "Yes, my preparation is complete… you are grinning too much. Sure, my condtion is good, but… You don't get carried away until you win, right?",
        "20029": "hey, let's go. I'm going to etch my name on every single person in the audience.",
        "20030": "No matter what the race, what I do is the same. I'm going to beat them all…!",
        "20031": "Condition? I guess so-so. Now if I can just do it like the practice…",
        "20032": "Are we in the real thing already? I wanted to make more adjustments, but… what can I do?",
        "20033": "I can't back out now, I'll do whatever I have to do, even in this condition!",
        "20034": "I have regrets, but there's no point in dwelling on it. As long as we get results, that's all that matters, right?",
        "20035": "Even if the adjustments are terrible, I'm going to win. I don't want to make excuses.",
        "20036": "The result is not determinde by your condition. You won't know until the actual competition.",
        "20037": "My condition is in shambles, I don't care anymore. No matter what the situation, I have to win…!",
        "20038": "Okay okay.",
        "20039": "I understand.",
        "20040": "This one.",

        "20049": "I've gained some strength, and I'd like to thank you in advance.",
        "20050": "I thought it could be better, but… well, it's not like this.",
        "20051": "It's not like we're used with each other.",
        "23015": "This one.",
        "30000": "Ahhhh! Next time, I'll definitely take the first place…!",
        "30001": "We're not done yet… We're going to go higher…!",
        "30002": "Not bad… but half-assed strength doesn't mean anything.",
        "30003": "Damn…! This isn't how it's supposed to be…!",
        "30004": "Huh! Did you see my true strength!?",
        "30005": "Heh heh… That's what I'm talking about!",
        "30006": "Well, Did you see it… my tuning!",

        "40003": "To heights no one else can reach…!",
        "40004": "…I can't do it? Give up? Don't underestimate me! put them all together… and shake them off…!",
        "60000": "Live huh… even though I'm already sattisfied with just winning the race.",
        "60001": "Fuuu, haaa…… Okay! Let's do it…!",
        "70000": "…If you don't come, I'll leave you.",
        "70001": "You've been a hot headed ever since we met. Don't you get tired with that tension?",
        "70004": "I'm not a fan of tight-fitting clothes. Uniforms… still okay.",
        "70008": "It's strange that everyone wears the same clothes.… It feel like I'm going to be buried in big guys.",
        "70009": "My own personal clothes… what are you looking at? Don't laugh.",
        "70010": "I'll have to buy a new uniform when I grow up. …I'll kick you if you say I don't need one, okay?",
        "70014": "I don't like to show off, but… I'll do the Live show. It's proof that we won.",
        "70015": "Don't ask me to be cute, okay? This is my style.",
        "70016": "What? It needs maintenance?",
        "70017": "CM shooting… will there be another one?",
        "70018": "Hmm, hmm ……♪",

        "81001": "I'm not done yet! I'm not going to lose to you.",
        "90000": "Haaa… I thought today would be the day I would be able to run on a course without other people. Too many early riser training idiots…",
        "90001": "…I wonder if we'll do the race, first thing in the morning. They say height is higher in the morning.",
        "90002": "How can they all eat so much for lunch? If I did, I won't be able to move.",
        "90003": "Huh… I think I'll take a nap. I wonder If there is place where Ticket won't find me… In the first place, how did she always find me?",
        "90004": "I'm not going home yet. I haven't reached my quota for today. I need to train more…!",
        "90005": "I heard that if I don't sleep, I won't grow taller, but I still have training to do… Ahhhh, there's just not enough time.",
        "90006": "It's getting warmer, maybe I'll take a nap on the rooftop…",
        "90007": "Ahhhh mou, Even though it's already hot, but Tickets are so noisy that it makes it even hotter…",
        "90008": "…It's been a while since I've done a fallen leaf bonfire. I like the flickering flames and the sound of wood burning… I quite like it.",
        "90009": "In winter, I think it's best to relax and have a one-person hot pot. It's warm and easy to clean up afterwards. … What, I won't call you, okay?",
        "90010": "…You have sleepy face. You're too lax. Want me to re-tighten the screws in your head?",
        "90011": "Haaah… I'm sleepy… I play too much because of the triple EXP. My level is getting higher and higher, so I don't know when to stop…",
        "90012": "VR Umarator, queue again… And reservations are full… I wonder if they will add more…",
        "90013": "That cloud… it looks like an airship or something will pop up. And save the world by riding on it… It's so cliché it feel lame.",
        "90014": "The workshop in the game smells like oil… but it's a strange smell that I can't get sick of.",
        "90015": "That enemy doesn't attack at all! You're doing great… developers. Damn… one more battle before I go to bed…!",
        "90016": "It's against the law to have caterpillars fall down! You made make a funny noise…! Let's not play games there…",
        "90017": "It's hot, but not too hot, because the VR workshop is scorching hot, like a sauna…",
        "90018": "I didn't know steam locomotives were still running. If you are in the area on an expedition or something, you might want to go see it…",
        "90019": "The battery on my phone is running down fast. It's like this when it's cold. Am I using it too much? No, but…",
        "90020": "…… Happy Valentine's Day!",
        "90021": "…… Happy Valentine's Day!",
        "91000": "Ticket shook me up and say, \"Taishintesto!\" I'm not a building.",
        "91001": "People are surprised when they look at my rank in mobile game…… I mean, It's normal if you've been playing for a long time, right?",
        "91002": "I was listening to the radio, and they were playing a song that I had requested. …Well, that's all.",
        "91003": "I can't wait to be able to do all my shopping by mail order… I hate crowds and I don't have to talk to store clerks…",
        "91004": "When I was removing stains from my clothes, Creek-san started praising me a lot… I just want to take care of my own things.",
        "91005": "Winning live, you know… who would have thought of making the winner of a race sing and dance, seriously.",
        "91006": "Haaaa, If we are using matching outfit the height difference is… ………nothing, forget it.",
        "91007": "I like the hood. It takes away the annoying stares and lets me concentrate on the race… and when I get to the finish line and take it off, I see a different scenery.",
        "91008": "Well, I noticed that I have a lot of asymmetrical clothes… …I think it's just a coincidence.",
        "91009": "I forgot my lunch box at the dormitory ……it's such a pain to go back… But the cafeteria has been crowded lately with all the sweets fairs and stuff… haaa.",
        "91010": "I went to the library during lunch break and Hayahide recommended a very thick book, saying it was a great book… I ran away.",
        "91011": "Oh, the event of that game ends today… well whatever. I'm just playing it to kill time…",
        "91012": "You should at least do a proper orientation for new students… Why do I have to be the one to guide them…?",
        "91013": "I'm thinking of going to some empty beach… I want to see sea anemones and stuff…",
        "91014": "A rare bird I saw in the park… I wonder if it was a migratory bird…? It's nice to be able to fly so far away.",
        "91015": "This school is so noisy in the winter with all the events… haah. I wonder if it will be quiet If it snows a lot … I guess not.",
        "91016": "Like putting on a button or inspecting horseshoes, etc… Does Ticket even know what an engineer's role is?",
        "91017": "Hayahide invited me to play a competitive puzzle game, and it looks like reaction time is the key. Well, I'm not just quietly accepting my lose.",
        "91018": "Teio's movement in VR was strange. Does it mean that the spring can't be reproduced in the game? Is she a real strong character?",
        "91019": "I bumped into Turbo earlier. We both got hit on the forehead. I really thought I was taller.",
        "91020": "I want to stare blankly at gears… The regular movement and rhythm… I feel like I can watch it all the time…",
        "91021": "This morning… I feel like I've wandered into a different world than usual… I've been playing too many games…",
        "91022": "Ah, Hayahide's scolding was long. I just played a game during dinner. Next time, I will try to make sure she doesn't find out.",
        "91023": "Oh no… I almost forgot about the app log-in. If I miss this, I'll be late for the equipment enhancement…",
        "91024": "It's getting nice and warm… Sometimes I go to the park for a walk … and play games.",
        "91025": "All the game commercials are full of swimsuits. What is it… I hate myself for feeling summer with this.",
        "91026": "I remember a game resident I played in VR steamed a baked potato with steam. Hmmm… weird world.",
        "91027": "It's cold. Let's start up Umarator… It's too convenient to warm up in the game. You can play and kill two birds with one stone.",
        "91028": "…hmm, what? What did you say? I have earphones in my ear covers, so it's hard for me to hear you.",
        "91029": "I have good eyesight, so I don't wear a monocle. I don't play games in the dark. That's how much care I take.",
        "92000": "I'm going to go as usual today.",
        "92001": "Whatever you do, don't cut corners.",
        "92002": "My preparation is complete. What are we going to do?",
        "92003": "We need to get to the bottom of this and catch up…!",
        "92005": "Well… you're my trainer. I'll follow your instructions.",
        "92006": "Don't worry too much.",
        "92007": "Your teaching style is… okay, I guess. It's Hot and annoying, though!",
        "92011": "Come on, let's do it quickly. It's a waste of time.",
        "92015": "First, we will break in. Then gradually increase the pace.",
        "92016": "Just give me a score based on your criteria. That's more exciting.",
        "92017": "I'll do it quickly. I'm already warmed up.",
        "92018": "Don't say something ikewarm like trial and error. I'm going to give it my all right from the start…!",
        "92020": "I don't mind if we work together. But if you drag me down, I won't accept it.",
        "92021": "You don't get involved too much, do you? You know your role.",
        "92022": "You're a [buffer] aren't you?… Backup, don't screw it up okay.",
        "93000": "Parter up with you… well, I guess it's fine.",
        "93001": "Yes. I think we got the result, didn't we?",
        "93004": "Thanks for the support… it wasn't bad.",
        "93005": "Not quite there yet. Next time we will go higher.",
        "95000": "Not ye… I still need to refine my sharpness…!",
        "95001": "No matter what obstacle, I will tear it down!",
        "95003": "Narita Taishin. I will kick you if you look down on me.",
        "95004": "Everyone keep making fun of me! I will run, and I will show them I can win!",
        "95005": "I'm troubled if you get your hopes up…",
        "95006": "I'll do it …Somewhat.",
        "95007": "Level up… not like this.",
        "95008": "Increased output… Go for it!",
        "95009": "Even if it breaks into pieces… I'll fix it again and again!",
        "95010": "Narita Taishin. Are you my assistant? Oh, well.",
        "110000": "What, are we going to train?",
        "110001": "History… not really interested.",
        "110002": "Are you entering the race? …I see.",
        "120000": "My body is hot… what is this feeling?",
        "140000": "You're going to do it? …Oh, yeah.",
        "140001": "Heh…",
        "140002": "Uh…",
        "140003": "Surprising. You are good at this kind of thing.",

        "20006": "Can we move a little closer to the edge? I'm afraid to train in such a large space.",
        "20007": "If I start with what I can do, will I be able to grow?",
        "20008": "I'm so dazzled by the rest of you, more so than usual… can we really catch up…?",

        "20023": "Condition is perfect…! A lot!",
        "20024": "Ha-ha-ha-ha!……… your spirit today is on par with that of Ms. Opera O!",
        "20025": "Now that I've prepared properly, I feel like I can exert more energy than usual.",
        "20026": "Maybe it's just my imagination, but I think I'm feeling a little better. …Just a little bit.",
        "20027": "For me, I think I might have done decently -……",

        "20030": "I thought I could do my best normally. …as long as I don't get my clothes caught in the gate…",
        "20031": "Soooo～ hah～… Stay calm… stay calm…!",
        "20032": "At this rate… No, it's nothing…! I just have to do it…",
        "20033": "This condition… I might be a little bit worried…",
        "20034": "I'm sorry… I'm not feeling well～… Oh, but I'll do my best…!",
        "20035": "How are you doing? Perfectly fine… I'm not good at all～… But I'll try somehow…!",
        "20036": "I'm in a terrible state, but miracles may happen… I'll keep on running…!",
        "20037": "Even if you're in a slump… if you don't give up and keep running, there might be a way to save your life… right?",
        "20038": "All right…!",
        "20039": "Can you do it…?",
        "20040": "Calm down…!",

        "23015": "Can you do it…?",
        "30000": "Oh, one more thing… No, nothing…!",
        "30001": "Third place……a little better…?",
        "30002": "Well, I managed to get in……………………",
        "30003": "Whew… sorry…",
        "30004": "I… hyaaaaaaaaa!? I did it!",
        "30005": "We could have won… yup!",

        "31000": "Yes, I'm coming!",
        "40000": "Someday, even I… okay…!",
        "40001": "Yo～! Huh? Huh! Hee～! Nn～? Huh～… Ah……… Yo～shi～!",
        "40003": "Wow, I'm not good!",
        "40004": "Yes, this way please… Here, here, don't come～! Oh… what?",
        "60000": "It's starting!",
        "60001": "I will sing as much as I can!",
        "70000": "If it's okay with me…!",
        "70001": "The trainer's words… I will keep them as my good luck charm from now on.",
        "70004": "It's still a dream come true! I can't believe I'm wearing the uniform of Tracen Academy…",
        "70008": "Wearing a fluffy costume makes me feel fluffy too!",
        "70009": "What do you think…? Have you been dressed in your best clothes?",
        "70010": "This is my 5th ribbon… I often snag or tear them…",
        "70014": "Ugh… I'd better not fall down at the concert and get my costume dirty…!",
        "70015": "In my bag are plasters and bandages. Now you are ready even if you mess up!",
        "70016": "I feel relieved when I look at the lantern lights.",
        "70017": "Candy tucked into sleeves, they're all falling out!",
        "70018": "Thank you……!",
        "70019": "I'm going to win.…… I'm going to win……!",

        "81000": "It's a game…! ………Hey, I said it…",
        "81001": "Ahhh… I can still do it…! I can still do my best…!",
        "90000": "Good morning. I'm sorry, do I have a sleeping habit…? It's not shaggy…?",
        "90001": "Opera O and Urara, you are always so energetic in the morning! I should learn from them too…!",
        "90002": "Have you eaten lunch? I… had to buy some more bread later because a bird took it away…",
        "90003": "I'm always sleepy after lunch… I have to make sure I don't join the next class like before…",
        "90004": "I feel at ease at night… I feel as if people will forgive me if I get depressed or depressed.",
        "90005": "Thank you for your hard work today! Tomorrow, I will do my best not to cause you any trouble…!",
        "90007": "I don't like summer… because it's too hot, but I like sunflowers and sparkling sunlight… I think I like those things…",
        "90008": "In a class assignment, we were asked, \"What's your favorite autumn season?\" but is there an appropriate autumn for me?",
        "90009": "I'm not afraid of the cold in winter. I used to live in the north when I was a child, and I have gloves and other gloves.",
        "90010": "Good morning! Let me show you around… Isn't today the day of the Haunted House?",
        "90011": "My stockings have holes…! I changed my stockings after Ms. Shakur taught me how to do it.",
        "90012": "Haunted houses are dark and scary… …Oh, if it was light at noon, would you be able to enjoy it even if you are scared?",
        "90013": "I'm sorry. The pumpkin pie I made for you all…………………………………left nothing but charcoal～～.",
        "90014": "It is very dark, so please be careful where you step. I fall down even if there are lights…",
        "90015": "Hyah! Trainer! Then the reason you ignored me when I tried to talk to you earlier… You've got the wrong person!",
        "90016": "The spring wind is scary, isn't it? My hat was blown off and I chased after it, only to get lost… I'm so sick of it!",
        "90017": "I dropped the huge pumpkin I harvested and cut it in half… I'll spend the rest of my life trying to save it～!",
        "90018": "What am I supposed to do as a prank…! Ugh… I'm dizzy from the pressure…!",
        "90019": "When I leave my hat outside on a cold day, a raccoon dog comes to hide in it. When I noticed her, she was breathing in her sleep… heh heh.",
        "90020": "Ha, Happy Valentine's Day!",
        "90021": "Ha, Happy Valentine's Day!",
        "91000": "When you are depressed, don't you feel like hiding behind something? Behind a building, behind someone…",
        "91001": "My parents are very kind. They said, \"Dotou is a great kid\"…even though that's not true at all…",
        "91002": "I am the King of the End of the Century! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Did I look like ………?",
        "91003": "I also have a relationship like that between Ms. Operao and Ms. Ayabe… No, I'm too afraid…!",
        "91004": "Aww… Ms. Taikishattle invited me to a party, but I think I'm out of place…?",
        "91005": "I don't like to wear clothes with many buttons. Because of my clumsy nature, I often misplace buttons…",
        "91006": "Aren't you nervous when you sing a fast-paced song? I'm afraid I'll chew…",
        "91007": "With this bag, I would be 100 times braver～. And strength… I hope it has that much.",
        "91008": "I love the bag and the ribbon on my chest, they are so cute! I feel like I will be cheered up when I wear it.",
        "91009": "Ugh, I thought my bag was heavy… but it wasn't my textbooks, it was my alarm clock!",
        "91010": "The carrot bread at the store… I'm a little curious about it, but I'm not sure I can make it if the first one to buy it wins…",
        "91011": "The streets at night are full of danger… I was so exhausted just going back to my dormitory…",
        "91012": "Cherry blossoms are dangerous… When I was walking around admiring the cherry blossoms, I hit a pillar and got a bump…",
        "91013": "The sea is dangerous… You may get your finger caught in a crab's mouth, or your float may be swept away……",
        "91014": "Yaki-imo is dangerous! If you don't let it cool down well, you'll burn your tongue like I did… hah…",
        "91015": "Snow is… beautiful but dangerous. I often slip and fall down hills… and become a snowman…",
        "91016": "I couldn't eat the candy, but I kept looking at it… and I could see my father's face in the jewelry store.",
        "91017": "Ms. Digital, you must be exhausted, falling down and getting up several times a day. Would it be a nuisance if I offered you something?",
        "91018": "Windy won't bite me. She says I'm crying too much and it's not good for me… I'm a little sad.",
        "91019": "Wheeeeee…! Whee～! So, is it done? Helios taught me how to do this Parisian thing…!",
        "91020": "Palmer-san, you made my enka songs so much fun… ehehe… Karaoke… I hope we can go again…",
        "91021": "My morning horoscope showed that pumpkin was my lucky item… hehehe…! Maybe something good will happen…!",
        "91022": "We bring snacks and sweets to the snack time with Ullala. I wonder what I should bring today…",
        "91023": "Recently, a cat comes to visit me at night. I wonder if they are interested in these clothes?",
        "91024": "Ugh… I'm a bad senior! I gently called out to a lost freshman and startled her to tears～!",
        "91025": "Do you have any water? I fell asleep with a pumpkin on my head and I'm sweating…!",
        "91026": "I… I definitely shouldn't be doing this. And yet you all look at me and say, \"I'm starving…\"!",
        "91027": "Yo, come this way if you like… The lantern is warm. How is it… is it helpful?",
        "91028": "When I wear a pumpkin, I feel like a different person. A little stronger, a little bigger…",
        "91029": "Why do crows always try to get me when I go outside? So many pumpkin crumbs!",
        "92000": "Please practice again today…!",
        "92001": "Which training would you like…? I can't decide… I would be happy if you could choose one.",
        "92002": "Sorry for the delay…! We've managed to finish preparations…!",
        "92003": "I'll try not to make any silly mistakes during practice, so… well, could you please guide me…?",
        "92005": "Even a little bit at a time… if we move forward, we can change… right?",
        "92006": "For the sake of my trainer who never gave up on me… I will grow even more!",
        "92007": "I thought I could show you a different me in training…! Maybe, just maybe… a little bit!",
        "92011": "But it's a training camp, and I hope you will train me hard…!",
        "92015": "I will do whatever it takes! And I know that the trainer's path is the right one…!",
        "92016": "Wow, let's use the power of the costume to turn them away so that nothing bad will happen to them…? I'm so excited…!",
        "92017": "Ugh… I'm fine. I just made the ribbon around her neck a little tighter so it wouldn't come loose… ugh.",
        "92018": "I'm different today. My heels are comfortable to walk on, and I've only fallen once…!",
        "92020": "It's difficult to become the person I want to be… But I don't want to give up…!",
        "92021": "Please let me know if there is anywhere you want to go…! I'll do my best to show you around!",
        "92022": "My trainer is my salvation… my guide… and I trust her with all my heart!",
        "93000": "Thanks to my trainer… I can live with my chest out～!",
        "93001": "Even for me… there was salvation～…!",
        "93004": "A future that has guided us… I hope we continue to move forward together!!!",
        "93005": "I was able to reach the goal without hesitation!",
        "95000": "I thought I had grown up a bit…!",
        "95001": "I…! I've changed so much…!",
        "95003": "Aww…! Meishoudou desu～!",
        "95004": "It's do-do-do-do-do-do-do! The dream is - eh, time is running out…!",
        "95005": "Oh, I don't know if I can help you…",
        "95006": "If I can be of any help…!",
        "95007": "Wow… it's like a fire was lit in my heart.",
        "95008": "You're guiding me all the way?",
        "95009": "I am the guide of souls… where am I?",
        "95010": "Meishoudou de suu. I believe we'll get there someday…!",
        "110000": "Um… what kind of training did you do today?",
        "110001": "It seems like there are lots of fun stories to tell!",

        "10105": "I brought chocolate. It's a thank you for taking care of an Umamusume like me…",
        "10109": "I was nervous when I was buying the present because the shopkeeper saw me… but I did my best. …Will you be happy with it?",
        "10111": "Happy Birthday. I hope my words will be enough to celebrate.",
        "10112": "I got you a present… Oh, don't get your hopes up… it's really not that big of a deal! Really!",
        "10114": "You don't have to celebrate my birthday… but… well, I'm glad.",
        "10117": "You completed the mission. That's amazing. I have to do my best not to lose to you, too.",
        "20000": "I feel heavy… ah, it's lie. It's just my imagination. Just… leave me alone.",
        "20001": "Let me… take a break. Then I'll work hard again.",
        "20002": "My legs feel so light right now…! Hey, have you started training yet? Let me run faster!",
        "20003": "I just want to run. I just want to run. I can't stop. I feel like I can do anything now!",
        "20004": "Yes, it looks good…! This will give me a satisfactory result.",
        "20005": "What are you doing today? Tell me anything. I'll do it!",
        "20006": "I have to work hard today… let me know what your plans are.",
        "20007": "If you don't want to lose, you're going to have to train hard. Let's get started, trainer.",
        "20008": "I'm just not in the mood. I want to do better.",
        "20009": "Huh… What? It's not unusual for me to sigh. It's just that I don't feel like doing it.",
        "20010": "Are there a lot of people touring, or is it just me? Oh… I can't concentrate like this…",
        "20011": "I know it's only in my head, but my legs can't keep up… I'm still myself afterall…",
        "20021": "What, are you serious about racing again? There's no way I can win now…!?",
        "20022": "Huh. What are you doing, racing back-to-back?",
        "20023": "I've adjusted well, haven't I? I'm sure I can win with this…! Watch me run.",
        "20024": "Maybe it's because I've prepared well, I'm not afraid of the stares of many people… I'm sure this will be fine!",
        "20025": "Soooo… yeah, perfect. All the preparation I've done for this day, I won't let it go to waste!",
        "20026": "I'm ready. I have a good idea of what the race is going to be like, and I'm going to ride as hard as I can.",
        "20027": "So far, things have been going rather well, haven't they? I'll be fine, I'll be fine. At this rate, I should be able to run as usual.",
        "20028": "I'm not even nervous, so I'm feeling good. All I need to do now is to be in high spirits……………",
        "20029": "Well… I'm a little nervous, but I don't think it's a problem. I'm off.",
        "20030": "Don't worry, I will be fine. I will just run as I train.",
        "20031": "I am quite calm. I guess the training has paid off.",
        "20032": "…I don't know, I guess I'm more nervous than I thought.",
        "20033": "I'm anxious, but don't worry. …I'll just do what I can.",
        "20034": "I don't feel comfortable… Maybe I'm in a bit of a hurry. …I have to run like myself.",
        "20035": "So many spectators… Oh my god…! Pull yourself together, Me!",
        "20036": "I can feel everyone's enthusiasm… I can feel everyone's enthusiasm…… I mustn't lose in spirit.",
        "20037": "Hey, what do I look like now? I don't know, don't tell me after all. I have to work hard anyway…",
        "20038": "Coming.",
        "20039": "Okay…!",
        "20040": "I'll do my best.",
        "20041": "Calm down…",
        "20042": "Oh no…!",
        "20043": "Oh…",
        "20046": "Then let's go.",
        "20047": "It's beautiful.",
        "20049": "We did a lot, a lot of hard work.",
        "20050": "Thanks, trainer.",
        "20051": "Just hang on and keep going…!",
        "20100": "…I feel kind of heavy. Oh, no, I'm fine. I'm fine like this.",
        "20101": "Huh… I guess I'm tired. Can I take a little rest first? I'll be able to work hard again after I do that.",
        "20106": "Okay, I'm going to try again today. Can you tell me what your plans are?",
        "20109": "I'm sorry. I just sighed. I'm just so motivated…",
        "20121": "What, another race? …I want to compete too, but I don't think I can win right now…",
        "20122": "Yes… But all those races have made me tired…",
        "20133": "To be honest, I'm a little nervous, but I'll do what I can.",
        "23015": "Okay…!",
        "30000": "It should still be possible…!",
        "30001": "I'm up there, too.",
        "30002": "I'll try harder and harder…!",
        "30003": "This can't end like this…!",
        "30004": "I'm not used to being proud of myself, but… not bad.",
        "30005": "I could do it… even me!",
        "30006": "Follow me. I'll take you to a better place next time.",
        "30007": "I could do it… even me!",
        "31000": "Just look at the goal…!",
        "40000": "I'm going where I'm going!",
        "40001": "The eyes surrounding me, the voices… Stop it! Yes, I'll go where I'm looking at…!",
        "40003": "I got you!",
        "40004": "Hmm? Wow… oh, wait! Wow! Thanks for showing me… ufufu♪",
        "60000": "It's okay, it's okay… I'll be there!",
        "60001": "I have to tell her how I feel…!",
        "70000": "Together, we will do our best, as much as possible…",
        "70001": "I was worried at first if I could get along with you… but now I'm fine. I'm used to it.",
        "70004": "I like them because they all have matching uniforms, and they're not needlessly conspicuous.",
        "70008": "I don't think I look good in such a cute outfit…",
        "70009": "This is the race outfit I choose for myself… I have to wear them with pride.",
        "70010": "If you wear this, it's easy to tell you're a student of Tracen Academy. We have to be firm…",
        "70014": "I am nervous to be on stage, but I have to show my appreciation.",
        "70015": "I'll make sure to run in a way that's appropriate for this outfit… I promise.",
        "70016": "Fresh wind, water… it's so nice to feel it directly.",
        "70017": "Where are you going next? We have to make plans, don't we?",
        "70018": "……～!",
        "70019": "I will run just like my ideal……!",
        "70101": "I was worried at first, but now that I've decided to work with a trainer, I'm fine.",
        "71004": "I like them because they all have matching uniforms, and they're not needlessly conspicuous.",
        "71008": "I don't think I look good in such a cute outfit…",
        "71009": "This is the race outfit I choose for myself… I have to wear them with pride.",
        "71010": "If you wear this, it's easy to tell you're a student of Tracen Academy. We have to be firm…",

        "71016": "Fresh wind, water… it's so nice to feel it directly.",
        "71017": "Where are you going next? We have to make plans, don't we?",
        "71018": "……～!",
        "71019": "I will run just like my ideal……!",
        "80000": "Good work.",
        "81000": "You want to race with me? … Okay, got it. I'll do my best!",
        "81001": "Great… but I can still do it! I won't let you down!",
        "90000": "Good morning. …What? I just said hello. Don't stare so much.",
        "90001": "It's hard to be graceful in the morning… I'm sleepy, I'm in a daze… McQueen is amazing.",
        "90002": "When I go out to lunch on my day off, everyone wears the cutest clothes… I can't do it.",
        "90003": "Can't we take a lunch break to work out? I'm not forcing myself.",
        "90004": "Are you still working until this late? You have another day tomorrow, so don't push yourself too hard and fall ill, okay?",
        "90005": "Hmmm… yawn… did you see my face just now? Forget it! Erase it from your memory.",
        "90006": "So many new students… They are so sparkling and dazzling that I might not be able to look at them directly…",
        "90007": "We have to watch out for the heat. If I fall down in front of everyone, I'll end up in the spotlight…",
        "90008": "I was thinking that I don't mind the smell of dead leaves, but then I smelled the aroma of baked potatoes coming from outside… did you think it was inside the school?",
        "90009": "Hey, don't get too close! Now there's static electricity.",
        "90010": "I'm not great at waing up, but… I have to get ready for a lot of things, so I just wake up while I'm doing it.",
        "90011": "Still sleepy? ……Why don't you put on something cool? It will wake you up a little.",
        "90012": "There's this café I want to go to. It's got a really nutritious menu… So… are we going? or not?",
        "90013": "Eating in an elegant way… isn't that something you learn when you are little? You don't want to be embarrassed at a dinner party…",
        "90014": "Do you need help with paperwork or something? I don't like the fact that you don't do anything when there is something you can do.",
        "90015": "…It's important to take a break once in a while. Why don't you go for a walk? The night air is so relaxing.",
        "90016": "You should be careful with the spring wind. If your hat or something gets blown away, it will be very hard to find it… I'll let you know.",
        "90017": "Don't yearn for a summer vacation… The sea breeze blows away your hat, and you find bottle mail on the beach … too dreamy…?",
        "90018": "Why don't we go to Kyoto to watch a race? It would be a good learning experience and the leaves will be changing soon……",
        "90019": "If you're cold, why don't you have something warm to drink? …I'll share a cup of ginger tea if you like.",
        "90020": "Happy…… Valentine's Day",
        "90021": "Happy…… Valentine's Day",
        "90100": "Good morning. …What? You're staring at me like that. Are you also sleeping in a bad habit?",
        "90103": "Can we use your lunch break for training? I'm fine, I'm not overworking myself.",
        "90104": "It's late… is trainer still working? Well, you know, don't take it too hard.",
        "90105": "Hmmm… yawn… did you see my face just now? Oh no… I'm so embarrassed…",
        "90109": "No, no, no, stay away from me! No, it's not that I don't want to, it's just that right now the static electricity is… oh no!",
        "90110": "How's it going? I think I did a little better with my hair…! I guess it was worth getting up early.",
        "90111": "Maybe you're still sleepy? …You should try to dress up in a cooler outfit. The morning breeze will make your eyes clearer.",
        "90112": "Hey, do you want to go to a cafe? I'd like to go out with you in this dress, and we can have tea together… how about that?",
        "90115": "Are you still working? …Why don't you come with me for a little walk? You might be more efficient if you take a break.",
        "90116": "Be careful of the spring wind. If you are careless and your hat gets blown off, you will have a hard time chasing after it…",
        "90118": "How about going to Kyoto to see the autumn leaves?",
        "90119": "If you feel cold, just let me know. I've got a pot of ginger tea for two.",
        "91000": "I told you to stop calling me \"Belle-chan\", but father… ah it's nothing!",
        "91001": "Don't ask me about my childhood. It's not all good memories.",
        "91002": "I has caused Ryan so much trouble in the past… I'm proud to say that I don't have to worry her anymore.",
        "91003": "Do you have younger siblings? Do you know how to deal with child… No, no, I'm just asking.",
        "91004": "The Mejiros are all very respectable. They are different from me.",
        "91005": "Everyone said I looked good in this outfit, but I'm sure they were just flattering.",
        "91006": "Tang, tang, turn… ♪ Fufu, fluffy… ah!? No, no, no, I was just practicing!",
        "91007": "It's a costume that I put my heart and soul into, I'm not going to run pathetically wearing this…!",
        "91008": "…Maybe it was a little too cute. No, no, it's a costume I decided on, I have to be proud of it…!",
        "91009": "Even if I want to train early in the morning, if I is not there when I get up from bed, Taiki is going to miss me…",
        "91010": "In the manga, they often make homemade lunches… I wonder if I can make them too…",
        "91011": "Training at night is so relaxing… I don't feel anyone looking at me and I can concentrate on my work…!",
        "91012": "…I like cherry blossom viewing. It's fun, it's beautiful, and everyone is paying attention to the cherry blossoms.",
        "91013": "I thought I heard something like thunder last night at midnight… haha, I like rain, but…",
        "91014": "If I'm not mistaken, today is a tea party with everyone in the Mejiro family under the autumn leaves.… Fufu, I'm looking forward to it.",
        "91015": "I cut back on sweets, and then… Oh no. Why do I gain weight so easily in the winter…!",
        "91016": "『You look super hot, like a model!』 Palmer, you are praising me too much…",
        "91017": "I like to go out with this, but I tend to take side trips and it takes a lot of time.",
        "91018": "You don't see my back right? I never thought that after a sunburn, my skin would never go away like this.",
        "91019": "It's soooo… nnn, it's nice. It's good for a change of pace, too.",
        "91020": "It's not safe to keep a bird of prey in a school in the first place… but they are such good friends… we have to take care of them anyway.",
        "91021": "Oh, the hair of the dog this morning. I've been seeing her on our walks lately… Hmmm, she's so cute and naughty!",
        "91022": "Is BBQ something you do every weekend? They always invite me… ah… or is that a joke from Taiki!",
        "91023": "Rob Roy said that reading a book before going to bed helps you sleep well… If you sleep well, you can thank Rob Roy.",
        "91024": "Hmmm. …What do you think? Would this make it easier for new students to talk to me? Should I raise the corners of my mouth a little more?",
        "91025": "The sun is shining, why don't you wear a hat? I'm thinking of something with a wide brim to prevent heat stroke… but don't wear the same hat…!",
        "91026": "I heard that most of the autumn leaves in England are yellow… No, I just looked it up because I have time on my hands. It's not that I want to go there…",
        "91027": "If I hide it with ribbons… no, no! I need to move and lose weight. I'll get rid of the excess flesh in the winter…!",
        "91028": "I would like to thank Ryan for these clothes. Maybe I can pick out the clothes this time? I'm going to go with something much cuter.",
        "91029": "This is the kind of hair set-up Bright does every day… I can't copy that fluffy look.",
        "91101": "I had some fun, but to be honest, I don't want to remember much of my childhood…",
        "91103": "Hey, hey, do you have younger siblings? I'd like you to tell me what I should do to make them happy.",
        "91104": "Everyone in the Mejiro family is so magnificent, and so admirable, but… I just can't… I just can't do it.",
        "91123": "Print is fine. If you read it before going to bed, you can get a good night's sleep… I'm paraphrasing from Rob Roy.",
        "91125": "When you go out in the summer, a wide-brimmed hat is the way to go! It's cooler, you don't get sunburned, and you can even match it up, right?",
        "91126": "I heard that the leaves in England are mostly yellow! The palace is absolutely beautiful…! Maybe we can go together sometime…?",
        "92000": "I'm ready, so get started right away.",
        "92001": "I don't care what's going on around me, I don't care… just focus on training…!",
        "92002": "I want to be strong. …That's why I choose you to be my trainer. So do it well.",
        "92003": "I'm not nervous or anything. I just want to run my race.",
        "92005": "Have you thought of a menu? Then tell me what to do. I'll make sure you get it right.",
        "92006": "I don't want you to be shy. So make me stronger.",
        "92007": "I trust you as a trainer… Just as trainer okay!",
        "92011": "If I'm going to train, it's now. I have to make sure I don't get left behind by everyone else…!",
        "92015": "All right. Now that the ribbons are tied, let's get to work.",
        "92016": "I wasn't expecting it because it's an athlete's nail polish, but looking at it this way, it's pretty stylish…!",
        "92017": "When I run in this dress, I feel like I'm the wind… and I don't have to worry about people's eyes on me.",
        "92018": "As a senior, I have to be a role model. I want to work harder.",
        "92020": "I'll do whatever it takes, even if it's on the perimeter. If I'm still worried about my surroundings,I still have a long way to go…!",
        "92021": "I feel like I don't mind being seen these days. Maybe it's because of the clothes Ryan picked out for me and thanks to a certain someone… a little?",
        "92022": "Hey, that place you said you were going next, is it somewhere you've been before? Or not? I don't care which one you've been to, but you need to decide quickly.",
        "92100": "I'm ready. We can start whenever you are.",
        "92102": "I want to be strong. …That's why I choose you to be my trainer. I'll leave the training to you.",
        "92105": "Have you thought of training menu? … Don't worry. I'll definitely get it done.",
        "92107": "I trust my trainer, and I intend to respond to that trust.",
        "92115": "All right. Now that the ribbons are tied up tight, we're ready to get started!",
        "92118": "I want to show the juniors that I'm doing my best as a senior. Even I can do it too, right?",
        "92121": "I feel like I don't mind being seen these days. I think it's because of the clothes Ryan picked out for me and the Trainer.",
        "92122": "Where were we going next? Somewhere you've been before? Or somewhere you haven't? I don't care which one, as long as we're together.",
        "93000": "I'm glad you're my trainer. No, it's nothing!",
        "93001": "I'm glad you're my trainer!",
        "93002": "Even like this I'm grateful okay… I… I'm not lying!",
        "93003": "I am grateful for this… thanks!",
        "93004": "I feel like we can go anywhere together… maybe.",
        "93005": "The best souvenirs may be the memories of the journey.",
        "93006": "Together, we can go anywhere!",
        "95000": "I can still do it…!",
        "95001": "I have to push my limits…!",
        "95003": "Mejiro Dober… Well, nice to meet you.",
        "95004": "I want to change…! That's why I keep running!",
        "95005": "I think I can do more.",
        "95006": "I want to help you, too.",
        "95007": "I want more… adventure!",
        "95008": "Since we're here, do you want to go somewhere to commemorate the occasion?",
        "95009": "Wanna go out somewhere? …just for a change, you know?",
        "95010": "Hat Good. …Mejiro Dober. Nice to meet you.",
        "110000": "You'll make me stronger right.",
        "110001": "It's a little embarrassing to remember the past…",
        "110002": "I need to gain experience and get used to racing…!",
        "120000": "This power… will not be wasted!",
        "140000": "Cute… which one, should I take?",
        "140001": "Yes!",
        "140002": "That's right…",
        "140003": "Amazing, so much!",
        "140004": "It could have been fun.",
        "140005": "I can't help it…",
        "140006": "Amazing, so much!",
        "140007": "It could have been fun.",
        "140008": "Hmmm…",
        "140009": "Haha…",
