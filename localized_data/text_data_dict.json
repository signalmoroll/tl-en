It's not nerves sending shivers \nthrough me, but something deep inside, an urge —— \n \n\"Haaaaaaaaaaah!!\" \n \n\"Duramente from the outside! Can you believe it, \nDuramente has found a way from the outside!!\" \n \nThat's right... it's the urge in my blood, the pride \nwithin its line.

To let them bloom. \n \nFor each of the numerous flowers laying within \nthe basin, so too a wish lay within me. \nPlip-plop, plip-plop. One by one, droplets fell \nunderneath this branch of the Satono tree, \ndrawing expanding rings upon the water's surface. \nI am reminded of drops from days past, drops which \nfollowed the curves of my cheeks. \nThe pile of unflowering flowers. \n \nI'll let them blossom this time, on the most \nfloriferous once in a lifetime stage. \nI'll let these flowers — these wishes — reach full bloom, \nlike this beautiful hanachōzu. \n \n\"Yeah.
